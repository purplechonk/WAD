      "description": "The concept of Kamma, or Karma often evokes feelings of fear due to its association with a universal system of punishment and reward. However, when explored through the teachings of the Buddha, Kamma takes on a profound meaning\u2014one that emphasizes the pivotal role of our intentions in shaping our destinies.\n\nContrary to common misconceptions, Kamma isn't a system of cosmic retribution; rather, it serves as a powerful reminder that our lives are influenced by the intentions behind our actions in body, speech and mind. There is no force of predetermined fate as our mindful choices have the transformative potential to reshape our lives.\n\nJoin us this Thursday as we explore this teaching and how we can break free from negative patterns in our lives.",

We estimate average elasticities of city population and built area to aggregate city building heights of 0.12 and-0.17, respectively, indicating that the largest global cities in developing economies would be at least one-third smaller on average without their tall buildings. Land saved from urban development by post-1975 tall building construction is over 80% covered in vegetation. To isolate the effects of technology-induced reductions in the cost of height from correlated demand shocks, we use interactions between static demand factors and the geography of bedrock as instruments for observed 1975-2015 tall building construction in 12,877 cities worldwide, a triple difference identification strategy. Quantification using a canonical urban model suggests that the technology to build tall generates a potential global welfare gain of 4.8%, of which only about one-quarter has been realized. Estimated welfare gains from relaxing existing height constraints are 5.9% in the developed world and 3.1% in developing economies.",

Love was Shakespeare\u2019s language; and we sing his language in Dobrogosz\u2019 My Rose songs and Harris\u2019 Sonnet, an effusive ode to the Bard. The modal harmonies and whole tone melodies create a tonal flux that bewitches and bewilders the ear, a restless love. To act or not to act on this crazy desire, ask the Three Flower Songs of Whitacre, and our final act is a telling of Bernstein\u2019s West Side Story\u2014the Ultimate Love Story, the story of \u2018til death do us part\u2014of a Romeo after every Juliet\u2019s heart.
